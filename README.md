# Solaris 3.0: Redefining Energy with Decentralized Trading & Solar Ownership

## Introduction

**Solaris 3.0** is an innovative blockchain-based platform aimed at revolutionizing the renewable energy market. The project is designed to address energy inequality and inefficient energy trading systems by introducing **decentralized energy trading**, **fractional solar ownership**, and leveraging **AI-driven pricing** and **quantum-resistant security**.

In this version (3.0), we've enhanced the platform's capabilities with real-time energy monitoring, a more intuitive user interface, and improved transaction efficiency through advanced smart contracts.

Key features include:
- **Fractional Solar Ownership**: Allowing users to buy and sell portions of solar panels.
- **Decentralized Energy Trading**: Enabling peer-to-peer energy trading on the blockchain for transparent transactions.
- **AI-Powered Pricing**: Using machine learning to optimize pricing based on demand, supply, and weather forecasts.
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Ensuring data and transactions are future-proof against quantum computing threats.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Using smart contracts to guarantee secure, transparent, and efficient energy trading.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading**: Users can buy and sell solar energy directly without relying on traditional utility companies.
- **Fractional Solar Ownership**: Users can invest in solar panels, earning a share of the energy produced, lowering the barrier to entry for solar energy investments.
- **Energy Tokenization**: Energy credits are tokenized on the blockchain to ensure traceability and prevent fraud.
- **Real-Time Energy Data**: Users can monitor their energy consumption and solar panel production in real-time.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: The AI system dynamically adjusts energy prices based on market demand, weather patterns, and local energy production.
- **Quantum-Resistant Smart Contracts**: The platform employs quantum-resistant algorithms to secure transactions against future quantum threats.

## Architecture

The Solaris 3.0 platform is built using the following components:

1. **Blockchain**:
   - **Ethereum Blockchain** for decentralized transaction management and smart contracts.
   - **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** for storing decentralized energy records.
   - **Smart Contracts** that govern energy transactions, fractional ownership, and pricing models.

2. **AI/ML Layer**:
   - Machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and pricing, optimizing transaction efficiency.
   - Weather data integration to adjust pricing based on solar energy production forecasts.

3. **Frontend**:
   - A responsive web application built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind css** for user interactions.
   - Integration with **Web3.js** to interact with the blockchain and manage transactions.

4. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js** server to manage user requests, blockchain interactions, and energy data processing.
   - **MongoDB** for storing non-blockchain-based user data, such as energy consumption and solar ownership records.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To set up the Solaris 3.0 platform, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **Truffle Suite** (for smart contract deployment)
- **Ganache** (local Ethereum blockchain for development)
- **Metamask** extension (for managing Ethereum accounts)
- **MongoDB** (for backend data storage)
- **Node.js** (for frontend)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fromjyce/Solaris-3.0.git solaris-3.0
   cd solaris-3.0
2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development

The platform will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

### Creating an Account

1. Open the **Solaris 3.0** web application.
2. Connect your wallet using **Metamask** to create or log into an account.
3. Once logged in, you can purchase fractional ownership of solar panels or trade energy with other users.

### Trading Energy

1. Navigate to the **Energy Trading** page.
2. Select the amount of energy to buy or sell.
3. Choose the price, which is dynamically adjusted based on AI algorithms.
4. Confirm the transaction, which will be processed through the blockchain.

### Monitoring Energy Data

1. Go to the **Energy Dashboard** to view real-time energy production from your solar panels.
2. Check your energy credits, consumption, and savings.

## Security

- **Blockchain-Based Transactions**: All transactions are secured and immutable on the blockchain.
- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: The platform uses quantum-safe encryption protocols to protect user data and transactions.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Our smart contracts undergo regular audits for security vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile Application**: A native mobile app for energy trading and monitoring.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: Enabling users to participate in governance decisions related to energy trading and platform upgrades.
- **Energy Storage Integration**: Incorporating energy storage systems (e.g., batteries) into the platform for more efficient energy use.
